# AdminerPasswordFreePlugin
A plugin for adminer.org, that allows you to login without using a password. Useful for example, if you are running xampp with default credentials. Be very careful. It is not a good idea, to run mysql without a password, anyway. Use at your own risk. Don't try this at home.
